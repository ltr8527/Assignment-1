# Assignment #1
<p> Hi my name is Lance Rice,this is my flyer for my computer application class. it took me about two to three hours to complete. I wanted to make a business flyer because I really enjoy making flyers and I chose to do it over an open house. I ended up picking a grey color as the background for the header and for the footer I picked the same color. for the pictures, I looked up some pictures of a living room and a bathroom of an apartment and saved them, and then put them into my flyer. The problem I had was finding something to use other than word because I have a mac book, but don't have a word so that was my problem that I ran into. I used pages for my flyer it was not hard to operate a very easy way, but it is very different from using word. The results of me making the flyer I thought turned out really good I would not change anything to it and I would definitely use pages again.
